## INTRODUCTION
I wanted to explore fashion store shopping behavior, so I analyzed a fashion store dataset to uncover purchasing patterns, top-selling products, and seasonal spending trends to help businesses refine their sales strategies and enhance the customer experience.

## KEY ANALYTICAL PURSUITS

1. Which gender dominates the customer base?
2. Does promotional strategies (subscription and promo code) impact sale?
3. Which payment methods drive the highest sales?
4. How does shipping preference impact overall revenue?
5. Which category is the best seller?
6. How does spending vary across seasons? 

## TOOLS USED/SKILLS DEMONSTRATED

18 columns
3900 rows

## DATA CLEANING PROCESSES IN EXCEL
1. Loaded the Dataset into Power Query Editor
Imported the raw dataset into Power BIâ€™s Power Query Editor to begin the data transformation process.
2. Performed Data Quality Checks
Examined the dataset for missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistencies to ensure data integrity and reliability.
3. Standardized Data Types
Converted the 'Purchase Amount (USD)' column to the Currency data type to support accurate analysis and formatting in reports.
4. Removed Irrelevant Columns
Deleted non-essential columns such as 'Age', 'Previous Purchases', 'Size', 'Color', 'Discount Applied', and 'Frequency of Purchases' to streamline the dataset and maintain focus on relevant variables for the analysis.


## ANALYSIS/FINDINGS

1. The Male gender dominates the customer base.
2. Clothing remains the top-seller.
3. Just 27% of the customers are Subscribers, Infact, none of the female customers subscribe.
4. 43% of the customers have taken advantage of the promo code so far. Again, none of the female customers are part of these 47%.
5. All the payment methods are being utilized very well by the customers.
6. Customers love free shipping but other shipping methods are not lagging either.
7. Fall tops seasonal spending trend.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. An in-depth survey should be conducted to identify barriers preventing female customers from engaging with the brand. The insights from the survey should be used to refine strategies, ensuring products, services, and marketing campaigns resonate with female preferences and expectations.

2. There's need to increase the accessibility and visibility of subscription options and promo codes to appeal to budget-conscious customers. This approach will not only encourage customer loyalty but also provide an effective incentive for new and repeat purchases.
