## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Conduct in-depth surveys to identify any barriers preventing female customers from engaging with the brand. These insights should be used to refine strategies, ensuring products, services, and marketing campaigns resonate with their preferences and expectations.

2. There's need to increase the accessibility and visibility of subscription options and promo codes to appeal to budget-conscious customers. This approach will not only encourage customer loyalty but also provide an effective incentive for new and repeat purchases.
